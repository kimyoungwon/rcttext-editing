Description: A flexible and user-friendly toolkit for performing impact analysis in randomized trials with outcomes generated through human, machine, and/or hybrid scoring of text data. Provides functionality  for feature extraction and aggregation,  applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning models for semi-automated text scoring, estimating model-assisted treatment impacts with respect to text outcomes under various randomized designs, visually representing found impacts on text outcomes, and additional functionality for performing text analysis using existing frameworks, especially quanteda.
